# Backend Dependencies Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **NumPy Compatibility Crisis**
**Problem**: NumPy 2.3.2 was breaking compatibility with packages compiled for NumPy 1.x
```
A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.3.2 as it may crash.
AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found
```

**Solution**: Pinned `numpy<2.0.0` to ensure compatibility with existing geospatial packages.

### 2. **Missing Email Validator**
**Problem**: Pydantic's EmailStr validation required email-validator package
```
ImportError: email-validator is not installed, run `pip install pydantic[email]`
```

**Solution**: Added `email-validator==2.2.0` and used `pydantic[email]==2.5.0` to include email validation support.

### 3. **Shapely/GeoAlchemy2 Compatibility**
**Problem**: Shapely and GeoAlchemy2 version conflicts causing geometry processing failures.

**Solution**: Pinned compatible versions:
- `shapely==2.0.2`
- `geoalchemy2==0.14.2`
- `fiona==1.9.5`
- `pyproj==3.6.1`

## New Optimized requirements.txt

The new requirements.txt contains only the essential packages needed for your backend:

```txt
# Core FastAPI and web framework dependencies
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
starlette==0.27.0

# Database and ORM
sqlalchemy==2.0.23
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
alembic==1.13.1

# Geospatial dependencies (with NumPy 1.x compatibility)
numpy<2.0.0
shapely==2.0.2
fiona==1.9.5
pyproj==3.6.1
geoalchemy2==0.14.2

# Pydantic and validation
pydantic[email]==2.5.0
pydantic-core==2.14.1
email-validator==2.2.0

# Background tasks
celery==5.3.4
redis==5.0.1

# Authentication and security
passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4
python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0
python-multipart==0.0.6

# Utility packages
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests==2.31.0
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed 400+ unnecessary packages** from the original requirements.txt
2. **Pinned critical versions** to prevent future compatibility issues
3. **Added missing email-validator** for Pydantic EmailStr validation
4. **Ensured NumPy 1.x compatibility** for geospatial stack
5. **Organized packages by category** for better maintainability

## Results Expected

After deploying with this new requirements.txt:
- ✅ NumPy compatibility issues resolved
- ✅ Email validation working properly
- ✅ Geospatial operations (shapefile imports) functioning
- ✅ Faster build times due to fewer packages
- ✅ More predictable deployments with pinned versions

## Backup

The original requirements.txt has been saved as `requirements-old.txt` for reference.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy with the new requirements.txt
2. Test all API endpoints, especially:
   - Plot order creation (email validation)
   - Shapefile imports (geospatial operations)
   - Authentication endpoints
3. Monitor for any missing dependencies and add them as needed
